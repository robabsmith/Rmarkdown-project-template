@article{Justiniano2015b,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc. U.S. households' debt skyrocketed between 2000 and 2007, and has been falling since. This leveraging (and deleveraging) cycle cannot be accounted for by the relaxation, and subsequent tightening, of collateral requirements in mortgage markets observed during the same period. We base this conclusion on a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated using macroeconomic aggregates and microeconomic data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. From the perspective of the model, the credit cycle is more likely due to factors that impacted house prices more directly, thus affecting the availability of credit through a change in collateral values. In either case, the macroeconomic consequences of leveraging and deleveraging are relatively minor, because the responses of borrowers and lenders roughly wash out in the aggregate. These results suggest that household debt overhang alone cannot account for the slow recovery from the Great Recession.},

I review theoretical and empirical work on household debt: its prevalence, level, growth, and composition, as well as various measures of consumer choice and market (in)efficiency, elasticities, and prices, including new evidence on how borrowing heterogeneity affects the distribution of the opportunity cost of consumption. I also discuss opportunities and challenges in policy evaluation. A key takeaway is that puzzles abound, and I highlight numerous avenues for further research.},

abstract = {We use a novel, representative survey to document the level of financial literacy among Swiss households and to examine how financial literacy is related to household investment and borrowing. We find that half of the respondents were able to answer three questions on basic financial concepts (compound interest, inflation and risk diversification) correctly. Financial literacy is lower among low-income and immigrant households as well as among women. Young households seem to be less familiar with the concept of inflation, while retirees are less familiar with the concepts of compound interest and risk diversification. We find that financial literacy is strongly correlated with financial market participation, voluntary retirement saving and mortgage borrowing.},

@article{Walks2013,
abstract = {Abstract Vulnerability resulting from debt is part and parcel of the risk society and a salient characteristic of current neoliberal times under financialized global capitalism. Rising indebtedness increases the susceptibility of homeowners to housing and labor market restructuring, and if the degree of leverage is very high, can threaten the solvency, living standards, and social stability of local communities. However, very little is understood regarding how levels of household indebtedness are spatially distributed within or across cities, and how private debt maps onto the geography of race, class, housing, urban form, and other social variables, especially outside of the United States. It remains unknown whether and how higher and unsustainable levels of indebtedness might be associated with urban growth, decline, suburbanization, gentrification, immigration, racialization, and/or greying. This article examines the spatial distribution of household debt in Canadian cities at multiple scales of analys...},
